## Overview

eKB is a set of RESTful APIs designed by [e-Artspace](http://www.e-artspace.com) to popolate and
query any knowledge base compliant with the [W3C RDF standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) 
and with the [Knowledge Exchange Engine Service (KEES) architecture](http://www.e-artspace.com/home/project/kees).

eKB APIs are part of all [LinkedData.Center services](LinkedData.Center).

## The knowledge base
eKB implements a semantic system where infomation is described as a set of 
statement according with the W3C standard 
[Resource Description Framework (RDF)](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/).

There are two disjonined set of statemens. *TBox* and *ABox*.
Together ABox and TBox make up the whole *knowledge base*:

 - TBox statements describe a system in terms of controlled vocabularies, 
for example, a set of classes and properties such as:
**All Students are Persons** or **There are two types of Persons: Students and Teachers**.

 - ABox are TBox-compliant statements about that vocabulary. 
ABox statements describe facts about things, using vocabularies defined in Tbox such as
**John is a Person** or **Mary has blue eyes**.

In other words, TBox statements are sometimes associated with object-oriented 
classes and ABox statements associated with instances of those classes.

eKB manages both TBox and ABox statemenst.

TBox statements tend to be more permanent within a knowledge base and so they are loaded during
the knowledge base initialization (KEES booting window). 
In contrast, ABox statements are much more dynamic in nature and they are reloaded (only if changed)
during the KEES learning window. A special type of ABox statements are those that are inferred
during the KEES Reasoning windows evaluating axioms and rules contained into TBox.

eKB always traks the provenance of each statement in ABox storing all information
as linked data in a graph database (quadstore).

## Configuration
A *Knowledge Base configuration* is a collection of metadata that describe
TBox or Abox Statements.

The [KEES Ontology](http://ontology.it/kees/v1) and [VoID ontology](http://www.w3.org/TR/void/)
define the vocabularies used to express the knowlege base configuration.

TBox resources divide into *Vocabularies* and *Rules*.

Both Vocabularies and Rules statements are stored in the default graph of the graph database.
All appliable rules are executed during the KEES Reasoning windows. 

All ABox statemenst lives in named graphs.

The uri of the knowlege base configuration MUST BE *urn:kees:kb* and all knowlege base metadata 
(such is configuration info) is stored in *urn:kees* named graph.


A minimal KB configuration is like:

    <urn:kees:kb> void:subset 
            [ kees:source <http://data.example.com/file1.ttl> ]
            [ kees:source <http://data.example.com/file2.ttl> ] ;
    .
    
A more detailed KB configuration is like:

    <urn:kees:kb>
        dcterms:title "demo" ;
        dcterms:description "Contains a partial copy of dbpedia"@en ;
        dcterms:license <http://www.opendatacommons.org/odc-public-domain-dedication-and-licence/>;
        wv:norms <http://www.opendatacommons.org/norms/odc-by-sa/>;
        void:exampleResource 
            <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin> , 
            <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physics> ,
            <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ludwig_van_Beethoven> ;

        #TBox
        void:vocabulary <http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1.owl>;
        kees:rule
            [
                a kees:Rule ;
                kees:ruleContent   """

                    PREFIX :<urn:test:>
                    IF {

                        ?ps gr:hasCurrencyValue ?price .
                        FILTER (?price >= 200.00).
                    }
                    THEN {
                        ?offering a :ExpensiveProduct .
                    }
               """.
            ]
        ;
           
        # ABox
        void:subset 
            [
                a kees:ABoxGraph;
                kees:source <http://data.example.com/file1.ttl> ;
                kees:accrualPeriodicity kees:montly ;
                kees:accrualPolicy kees:simpleLearning ;
            ],
            [ kees:source <http://data.example.com/file2.ttl> ] ;
    .

    
The knowledge base configuration is always initialized with:

    <urn:kees:kb> a kees:KnowledgeBase ;
        foaf:homepage <> ;
        void:feature 
            <http://www.w3.org/ns/formats/RDF_XML> ,
            <http://www.w3.org/ns/formats/Turtle> ,
            <http://www.w3.org/ns/formats/N-Triples> ;
        void:sparqlEndpoint <sparql>;
    .

## Autentication

To access eKB APIs you always need to provide your LinkedData.Center credentials using
[http basic authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication):

+ Authorization ... [Base64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded string literal in form _"username:password"_ preceeded by authorization method and its space.


## Content negotiation
All eKB APIs supports [http content negotiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation) 
for state representation rendering.
Following MIME types are supported in the Accept header: text/html, application/rdf+xml, text/turtle.
Support to other mimetype  like application/x-turtle, text/x-nquads OR application/ld+json 
is experimental.

You can use *_output=mimetype* parameter in any URL to override http content negotiation 
and forcing your preferred resource representation.

Error representation is based on [ietf specs](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-problem-07).
Here is an example of a 404 error in json representation:

       HTTP/1.1 404 Not found
       Content-Type: application/problem+json
       Content-Language: en

        {
            problemType: "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:HTTP_status_codes"
            title: "Job not found"
            detail: "Job report 5441392469671 not found."
            problemInstance: "http://dbpedia.org/resource/HTTP_404"
            httpStatus: 404

## SPARQL API [/{kb}/sparql{?query,cache}]

**Protection from inconsistent data**

The knowledge base may be in a state temporarily inconsistent during the phases 
of acquisition of new data (learning window) or during the steps of the inference computation (reasoning window).
During these temporary windows, the result of the query to the knowledge base may be incorrect.

The endpoint is protected by a guard that prevents query during learning and reasoning windows. 
In these cases, any access to the endpoint receives a 503 error (Service Unavailable). 

**Transparent cache management**

eKB APIs cache partial query results in a very efficent and transparente way. This because we manage data ingestion through
KEES learning and reasoning window (see "task" API).

You are still able to manually submit a sparql update query but in this way you colud break the cache integrity. 
In order to protect you from this case, sparql end point accepts only safe sparql queries statements (select,cosntruct, ask and describe). 
If you want to manually submit a sparql update query (i.e. LOAD) you must add the optional paramether cache=clear. 
This force cache to revalidate after the execution of your statements. Please note that a using cache=clear can be slower and costly.


+ Parameters
    + kb (required, string, `demo`) ... `id` of the Knowlege base  
    + query (optional, string, `SELECT%20*%20WHERE%20%7B%3Fs%20%3Fp%20%3Fo%7D`) ... url encoded sparql query.
    + cache (optional, string, `enable`) ... block access during learning.
    
        | Value        | Meaning                                                |
        | ------------ |:------------------------------------------------------:|
        | enable       | transparent query caching is enabled (default)         |
        | clear        | force a cache validation before executing query. Mandatory for all sparql update queries|

        + Values
            + `enable`
            + `clear`


+ Model (application/sparql-results+xml)

    See [SPARQL Query Results XML Format](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-XMLres/) for more info.
            
    + Body

            <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
            <sparql xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2005/sparql-results#'>
                <head>
                    <variable name='s'/>
                    <variable name='p'/>
                    <variable name='o'/>
                </head>
                <results>
                </results>
            </sparql> 

### SPARQL query via get [GET]
This end point implements [SPARQL 1.1 protocol](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/) 
for [query](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) and [update](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/) language specifications.
It also supports [Service Description](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/) specification.

SPARQL query APIs support [http content negotiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation) for state representation rendering.

All HTTP requests that are mutative (add or remove) must include a valid Content-Type header set to the MIME type of the request body,
 where “valid” is a valid MIME type for N-Triples(text/plain), Turtle (application/x-turtle or text/turtle), NQuads (text/x-nquads), JSON-LD(application/ld+json), or RDF/XML (application/rdf+xml).
 
Depending from SPARQL query, following MIME types are recognized in the Accept header:

| Query type | Supported MIMETYPE in Accept header                                                                |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SELECT     | application/sparql-results+xml OR application/sparql-results+json                                  |
| ASK        | application/sparql-results+xml OR text/boolean                                                                                       |
| CONSTRUCT or DESCRIBE | application/rdf+xml OR text/turtle OR application/x-turtle OR text/x-nquads OR application/ld+json |
| any sparql update query |application/sparql-results+xml OR text/boolean (requires cache=clear option) |

If no query parameter is supplied it returns 
[end-point service Description](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/) in one of available RDF serialization.
